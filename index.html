			<h1>Self introduction 106042005 邱捷妤</h1>
			<p>
				I am Chiu, Chieh-Yu, a senior student majoring in foreign language and literature at National Tsing Hua University. I was brought up in Hsinchu County and then moved to Hsinchu City when I graduated from junior high school. <sub>So basically, I’ve never left Hsinchu in my whole life</sub>

				I am going to talk about my college life briefly. Being an introvert person, I didn’t have many friends during my high school life. Thus, I started to attend as many activities and clubs as possible. As the result, I became one of the members of the student association of the department, the Care-life club, the volleyball team, and the acapella club. In my opinion, the easiest way to make friends is to become those who hold the events. I spent a lot of time trying to become the one who I want to be, a person who outgoing and initiative. However, I found out that this kind of “interesting and productive” life wasn’t what I wanted. Therefore, I started to spend time on things that I am interested in. I spent time practicing my drawing skills, learning how to edit video clips, and working out to keep myself fit. I found that spending time on myself instead of living someone else’s life is more meaningful to me.

				Coming from a loving family, I was able to explore what I am interested in. This makes me a creative and independent person. Despite the time that I cared more about what people think instead of what I want, I would say that in my spare time I am always creating something. I draw illustrations, write stories, and make music by myself. I believe that even when I am drawing a portrait of someone, I am creating an image that stands for my observation of that person. Soon, I am planning to develop my hobbies of “creating something” into my sideline.
			</p>
			<p>
				To sum up, I am a person who is learning how to be myself. Previously, I was always thinking about how people think about me which had influenced my life a lot. After I realized that I have to choose for myself instead of thinking what is most expected, I allowed myself of being a creative person.

				How can a person survive in a foreign country by themselves when they cannot speak the local language? Having the experience of living in Salamanca, a city which is in the north-west part of Spain, for two months as an A1 Spanish speaker, I want to share something with those who are interested in planning a study tour for themselves. 
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				Living in Salamanca by oneself requires several essential skills and sufficient information, especially for a person who can barely speak Spanish and never went to Spain before. First of all, you will need to do some researches beforehand, including why to choose the city, when to go, where to live, how to get there, and what to do. After you have done gathering the information, you can start to arrange the accommodation and language school if needed. Finally, when you get there, you will have to deal with several problems.

		<h1 style="padding-top: 5vh; padding-left: 5vh;">Why to choose the city? 為什麼要選擇這個城市？</h1>
		<article >
			<p>
				There are three reasons why you should choose Salamanca as your destination for the study tour in Spain. First, the oldest university in Spain, Universidad de Salamanca, is located in this city. Because of the location of the university, the main population of the city is the elderly and the students who study at the university. Due to the composition of the population, there aren’t many English speakers in this city, which makes Salamanca the best city for a beginner who knows basic vocabularies and grammar to practice their speaking ability. Second, comparing to other cities in Spain, Salamanca has a lower cost of living and better public security. <strike>At least you don’t have to worried about being robbed if you open the windows when you are asleep.</strike> Last but not least, being one of the oldest cities in Spain, the courses are taught in a more accurate pronunciation in this city. Therefore, for people who want to learn classic Spanish, Salamanca is the best choice of theirs.

				之所以推薦薩拉曼卡作為遊學的目的地有三個原因：1.薩拉曼卡大學，西班牙最古老的大學之一就位在這個城市。作為一個大學城，這個城市主要是由老人與學生組成的，然而因為這個原因，在城市中並沒有太多會說英文的人。因此對於一個想要練習口語能力的初學者來說，這裡算是一個練習說西語最好的城市。2. 相較於西班牙的其他城市，薩拉曼卡的生活開校較低，也有比較好的治安<strike>至少你不需要擔心自己會在睡夢中被入室搶劫</strike>3. 作為西班牙最古老的城市之一，薩拉曼卡的語言課程教授的都是較為正統的口音，因此對於想要學習正統西文的人來說，薩拉曼卡是最好的選擇。

		<article>

				If you are a college student whose wish is to improve your Spanish as I did, the only choice of yours is to go there during summer vacation, which is a perfect time to go to Salamanca for a study tour (and for a vacation). Summer in Spain can be very torrid, the temperature is usually around 40 degrees centigrade at noon. Not to mention the fierce sun hanging in the sky, people tend to stay indoors during their lunch break. However, although the temperature can be very high under the sun, the temperature in the shadow is relatively low (around 19℃ based on my experience). Because of the temperature difference, it is normal that the accommodation where you stay during your study tour is without AC. Besides, because of the Mediterranean climate, it is usually hot and dry during the daytime. Comparing to the weather in Hsinchu (where the writer has lived for 21 years) it is way more comfortable living in Salamanca.

				For those who love shopping, I strongly recommend you to go in January or July, which is the discount season in Spain. When you can buy those clothes, accessories, and make-ups at half of the price, why would you choose to buy it at its original price and pay an extra shipping fee? To sum, in my opinion, the best time to go to Salamanca is in July.

				如果你和我一樣，是個想要加強自己西語能力的大學生，那麼你只有一個選擇，在暑假的時候安排你的旅行。以我的觀點來看，這段時間不只是度假的好時段、更是規劃遊學的黃金月份！雖然西班牙的夏天非常炎熱，室外陽光下的溫度可以達到攝氏40度之高，更不用提到在這樣天氣下毒辣的紫外線，連當地人在午休的時候都建議待在室內。然而因爲溫帶地中海型氣候的影響，西班牙在夏天極少降雨，而在陰涼處的溫度也只有大概19度左右。（跟筆者住了21年的新竹相比其實還算宜人居住）因為室外乾熱陰涼處溫度不高的天氣，西班牙的房屋內通常沒有冷氣。

		<article>
			<p>
				For an A1 speaker, the most important thing that you should do is to find a place to learn Spanish. There are many language schools for you to choose from. Since Salamanca is a small city, you will not have to worry about how far the language school is. However, I will still suggest you choose a school which is near your accommodation if possible. In that case you can spend more time exploring the city than wondering on the street when you get lost. <br/>
				As an A1 speaker, it is impossible for one to speak Spanish like a native speaker and remember every word that you might have to use in your daily life. Therefore, when you arrive the city, the first thing that you have to do is to find yourself a place to apply for a SIM card and keep your online dictionary with you all the time. If you are a person who cannot live without the internet, my suggestion for you is to get a SIM card from your country and charge the SIM card via the website or at the nearest mobile shop in the airport. However, if you forgot to buy it before your trip, here’s some useful vocabularies for you.

				對A1的西語學習者來說，來西班牙旅行最重要的莫過於學習西語。因為前述的幾個原因，薩拉曼卡有非常多的語言學校。而因為城市腹地不大的關係，其實語言學校的距離並不是遊學者需要擔心的最大問題。但根據個人經驗，筆者還是建議選擇離住處最近的語言學校，將通勤迷路的時間花在更有意義的事情上！<br/>
				作為一個A1程度的西語講者，要將日常所需的單字和文法全部記得滾瓜爛熟是非常困難的。所以我建議在抵達城市時要做的第一件事便是解決網路問題並且隨時開著線上字典翻譯西文。如果你是一個沒有網路就不能生存的人，那我建議你最好在自己的國家時就先申辦好當地可以使用的SIM卡，或者在機場就先將網路問題處理好。但如果你和我一樣，來不及在機場辦卡又忘記在本國先買的話，以下是幾個你可能會用到的單字和片語。

				After you have arrived your destination and solve your internet problem, there are several places that you should mark on your map. <br/>
				I.	La Plaza Mayor:<br/>
				All roads lead to La Plaza Mayor, there’s nothing else to explain. <br/>
				II.	Carrefour:<br/>
				There are no 7-11s and Family marts in Salamanca, nor are there 24hrs MacDonald’s in this city. If you are used to the convenience stores that will open 7 days a week 24 hours a day, you will have to get used to a place where the stores will be closed at 10 pm and the whole Sunday. Except for one place…... “Carrefour Express”, the only store that will open on Sunday and the only place you can get food after 10pm. 
			</p>
			<p>
				而當你到達你的目的地並解決網路問題之後，這裏有幾個地點是必須要加入你的GOOGLE MAP精選地點中的！<br/>
				I.	La Plaza Mayor 主廣場:<br/>
				俗話說：「條條大路通主廣場。」沒有其他好解釋的，標就對了！<br/>
				II.	Carrefour 家樂福:<br/>
				在西班牙並沒有所謂24小時營業的便利商店或者麥當勞，大部分的店都會在晚上10點左右關門，而且在週日是不營業的。除了你最好的夥伴「家樂福」！人稱「綠色家樂福」的Carrefour Express是唯一一個會開到晚上十點以後並且在星期天還會營業的店家。

		<article style="padding: 5vh;">
			This website is suitable for the following kinds of readers:<br/>
				1. Those who are interested in planning a study tour in Europe.<br/>
				2. Those who are interested in the cultural difference between Taiwanese and Spanish.<br/>
				3. Those who are interested in reading the journals of a twenty-year-old bold woman who dares to travel all by herself in a country that she had never been before. <br/>
				4. Those who are forced to read these weird articles. <br/><br/>

				If you belong to those people above, welcome to my website. In these articles, I am going to share my experience and the information that I considered important for living in Europe for two months by myself.
